Buggy line:
return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);

CURE's patch:
return fit(( double [ ] ) guess ) ;

Developer's patch:
return fit(guess);


Explanation:
Given the declaration of guess, 
final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();
CURE's patch is equivalent to developer's patch.
