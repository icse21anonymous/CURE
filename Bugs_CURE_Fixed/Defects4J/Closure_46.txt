CURE's patch:
public JSType getLeastSupertype( JSType that ) { return super.getLeastSupertype( that ) ; }


Developer's path:
delete this method


Explanation:
CURE's patch makes the getLeastSupertype() method in RecordType class the same as its father class's getLeastSupertype() method, which is equivalent to delete this method in RecordType class.
