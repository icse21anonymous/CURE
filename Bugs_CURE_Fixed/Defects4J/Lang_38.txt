Buggy line:
calendar = (Calendar) calendar.clone();

CURE's patch:
calendar.setTime( calendar.getTime( ) ) ;

Developer's patch:
calendar.getTime();
calendar = (Calendar) calendar.clone();


Explanation:
Based on the bug report in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-538,
the only requirement to fix the bug is to call getTime(), which is done in CURE's patch.
